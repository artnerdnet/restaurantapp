# RESTAURANT APP

For this project I implemented a service worker, I made the app accessible using ARIA and I used flexbox to make it responsive.

For the Map, Mapbox was used.  

## How to use this app

1) Clone this repo and open it in a terminal.
2) You are going to need a live server. For that you can use nodeJS and install http-server
  2. A. npm install http-server
  2. B. http-server
3) Your site is live. If you are having problems with the origin, use this extension for your browser:
    [Mozilla Firefox Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/access-control-allow-origin/)
    [Google Chrome: Allow-Control-Allow-Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi)
 4) Don't forget to change in the dbHelper.js file the number of the port (8080).
 5) Go to http://127.0.0.1:8080 to see your live app!
